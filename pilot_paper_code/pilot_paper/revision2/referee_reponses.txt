Thank you for all your helpful comments. We have included our responses, 
preceded by ‘>>>’, after each of your comments.

Abstract:

It is still unclear that there are systems associated with
multiple galaxies There are not 48 galaxies. The sentences 48 Lya
systems which we have paired with individual galaxies is not correct,
This would imply 48 galaxies. Please determine how to word this such
that the experiment is clear.

>>> We have adjusted the wording in the abstract to explicitly state this.


Introduction:

In the end of the introduction, you still mentioned the method is unbiased,
how so, please explain. It is reproducible and analytic but where or when
does it become unbiased? It is biased towards the selected method
right? This method is an explicit bias is it not?

>>> We changed the word “unbiased” to “numerical”


Section 2.1:

Regarding luminosity completeness. From Figure 1, you state that the sample is
magnitude or luminosity complete down to 0.2L* between 0<cz<2500 and
around 1L* between 2500<cz<6000. This conclusion is drawn from the
fact that the luminosity function is increasing (as expected) towards
lower luminosities and the completion is defined where your distribution
deviates from the expected luminosity function. This is clear in the
first two panels that the function flattens or drops after 0.1L* and
1L* for two panels respectively. Maybe this is a typo, but it is then
stated that 0.2L* at cz>6000 and even at 10,000? Do you mean 2L* since
the the distributions of the last two panels flatten around 1-2L*.
Can you check this please?

>>> See the bolded text in Section 2.1 for this explanation. In short, there
is a turnaround beyond cz ~6000 because SDSS data becomes available
and is complete to ~0.2 L*, although there is some weirdness in the
6000-8000 km/s region, which we have also addressed in the text.


Section 2.2:

Given that there is a different approach to splitting what is
typically known as a "system" (which is a continuous absorption system
where it does not return to the continuum level at any point in between),
it would be good add to Section 2.2 how systems (like in Figure 2)
are split, how their centroids, EWs, etc are calculated. This is a key
feature of the paper that is missing and would complete the entire
manuscript. As noted in the discussion, you select this method
since clouds could be physically distinct, but please recall that
the definition of a velocity clouds/components/subsystems are
resolution dependant so your method has resolution dependence.
In Section 2.2 you can also make clear that you have 33 sight-lines
with XX absorption systems, which have been split into 48 components,
which were associated with XX galaxies. Thus galaxies may be
associated with multiple clouds/components (whatever wording you
like). This needs to be clear early on in the manuscript.

>>> We have added further discussion of these points to Section 2.2.


Figures:

Please indicate in your figure captions that open points are r<Rvir
and closed are r>Rvir to help the reader. You may also consider
adopting this point style for Figure 10 as well just for consistency.

>>> Done.


Section 3.3:

1) You quote that the EW of blue and red to differ (recall this difference
is less than 1 sigma - therefore no statically significant difference)
and are 329\pm52 and 245\pm34 for ble and red respectively. Also, however,
Table 1 shows that the average impact parameters for blue and
red are 218\pm17 and 298\pm23 kpc, respectively. Thus, the different
impact parameter ranges covered by the two, and as the authors have shown
that EW is anti-correlated with impact parameter or normalzed by Rvir, implies
that likely a significat difference could be the result of impact parameter.
This should be mentioned. Recall the difference is less than one sigma.

>>> Good catch, we have adjusted the discussion of this in section 3.3.


2) You state that EW, dv and rho/Rvir must all be connected and
anti-correlate. In Figure 7, you can see that the open circles
(especially the red) have a lower velocity spread than the gas above
Rvir. How does this fit in with your conclusions? Also, is it possible
that the blue side has a tendency to have lower velocity range as
the red is due to the fact that it probes on average lover impact
paramaters (Table 1)? Can you comment on this?

>>> We have added mention of this at towards the end of section 3.3.


Conclusions:

It is not scientifically correct to say you find "a slight dichotomy" in
the EW for blue and red given the difference is less than one
sigma. There is no statistical support to show any significance,
never-mind much significance.

>>> We have removed this. It was a remnant from an earlier version
of this paper when at the time we thought there was a significant
difference, which then disappeared with the final analysis.
