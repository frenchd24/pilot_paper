Thank you for all your helpful comments. We have included our responses, 
preceded by ‘>>>’, after each of your comments.


Overarching comments:

1) When I first read the abstract, I understood there to be 48
individual galaxies with Lya absorption, however, the absorption
systems as shown in Figure 2 are split. Although the authors have an
analytic way of associating gas to one of the galaxies, it is
impossible to state how the clouds differ and is a contrary approach
to previous works where absorption systems are considered as one
system within some velocity window (as in 400 km/s Wakker \& Savage
2009). So I wondering why this is done? What does it physically mean
since there can be a location/relative velocity degeneracy? Also how
can you then compare to previous studies when you are double counting
2 absorbers per galaxy orientation in some cases. Splitting by does
have some merit when looking and the velocity distributions etc.,
though.

>>> Good point. We addressed this in detail in the new discussion section.
In this pilot sample we wanted to do both the simplest and least
ambiguous thing, i.e., make as few assumptions about the absorbers as
possible. In Paper II, with the full sample in hand, we will address this 
issue from both sides.


2) I think this paper will have a high impact, and what I am mostly
concerned about is the standard apples and oranges comparison. I think
it is important for us in the community to understand and explain this
to the rest of the readers to say why it is possible we see these
differences rather than just saying we see conflicting results since
this only adds the the confusion rather than clarifying our image of
the CGM. Yes, hydrogen my trace different things from metals but why?
Thus, you should consider the following or have some discussion in the
discussion section (which does not exist in this manuscript and
should).

-Previous results are incorrect and suffer from low number
statistics. This is likely, yet a consistency with a number of
studies now make it less likely.

- column density limits: Previous orientation work focused on
metal-lines typically associated with LLS. This is a main difference
between the Mathes work and the Kacprzak work. Here, although the
column densities are not listed, they all appear to be very low. We
have see in the past, that low column density systems as in Cote et
al. 2005 show no evidence to Lya co-rotating with the galaxy, however,
numerous studies such steidel+2002, Chen+05, Kacprzk+2010,
Diamond-Stanic+2016, Ho+2016 for metal-line (typically LLS) do
exhibit co-rotation. So column densities are an important aspect to
consider when understanding what is being traced when.

- Impact parameter selection, it is critical here that when comparing
results, we understand the impact parameter distributions and are they
within 1Rvir or not. In this sample, less than 1/3 have impact
parameters within 1Rvir. Other previous works were limited to much
lower impact parameter ranges (thus, likely higher column density
systems), which could change the results. This hopefully can be
tested with your larger sample. A combination of impact parameters
and column densities is the main difference between a null result
in Mathes+14 and Kacprzak+15.

>>> Open symbols are now used in relevant figures to denote systems
with impact parameter <= R_vir. We also address this in the new discussion
section.


- picking the largest galaxies in the pilot sample, i.e, most massive
galaxies could provide a difference of conclusions since these
galaxies are likely above the critical halo mass where cold accretion
is expected to occur (at least within simulations). Other studies focus
mostly on sub-L* galaxies, where this is not likely the case.

>>> Our added discussion section hopefully addresses these concerns.



Detailed comments:

Introduction

The authors should cite works by Borthakur+, especially
Borthakur+15, which is very relevant to this work.

>>> Yes, thanks for the suggestion. Done.


page 2, column 1
States that at low redshift, one can unambiguously associate absorbers
to galaxies. This is not true, you have better detection threshold for
very low mass galaxies, but in the cases such as Figure 2, the gas was
assumed to be associated with the more massive/closer galaxy. This
assumption is similar to higher redshift, except we may not
potentially see the lower mass galaxies, but the result is the
same. Or if the authors do not like that argument, you still can't
unambiguously associate the gas to the bigger galaxy in Figure 2. It
is an assumption based on known gas radial profiles etc. So the
association is based on (well found) assumptions, which is not
unambiguous.

>>> We agree, and have removed all usage of “unambigous” from
the manuscript. What we were attemping to say was “unbiased”, or 
“reproducible,” and this has been implemented. 


page 2, column 1
``...Stated Werk+ 2014 are complete to ~L* at z\sim0.2)' This is false.
The average of their galaxy sample is around 0.6L*. They are sensitive to lower
luminosity limits of 0.1L*. Please have a detailed look at their work and
the work of others.

>>> Yes, this error has been fixed.


page 2 column 1
The authors make a big point that they previous works suffer from
small number statistics and that more data is needed to understand
the CGM. However, this pilot paper has around 30 (individual)
galaxies. This this is the same as (or less than) previous works.

>>> Indeed, this pilot study suffers from these issues as well. We have
adjusted language to address this.


page 2 Figure 1
Would be helpful if you could make Figure 1 a bit bigger or at least
make the labels bigger.

>>> Done.


Page 3 Table 1
Please fix the format for RA and DEC. DEC does not need the .0
and the end of each entry.

>>> Done. 


Page 4, Sec 2.2
The authors have sorted their database and selected galaxies
with D>25 kpc ensures you select the most massive galaxies. I think
this needs to be discussed (as I pointed out above) on how
this could possibly affect your results. This is a good reason
to have a discussion section. Also the impact parameter range
is at least 2x higher than previous works.

>>> Done, see the new discussion section.


Page 5 Section 3.0
I wonder why in your equation you use a velocity normalization of
v=200, why not use the escape velocity of the halo, which corresponds
to your Rvir?

>>> We added some discussion of this decision.


Page 5 Section 3.0
I am still unclear why you split the absorption systems and not use
the classical assumption that it is all one absorption system? This
has complicated assumptions and does it have any physical meaning?

>>> We have address this in the new discussion section.


Page 5 Section 3.1

Also see Churchill+ 2013 who also show for metal-lines that the
anti-correlation between EW and rho is stronger when normalized
by Rvir.

>>> Thanks, we added this reference.


Figures 3,4, etc. Can you put error bars on the bins?

>>> All the bins we use are qualitative only, and we never state their 
actual values (much like those in, e.g., Borthukar+ 2015 or Kacprzak+ 2011). 
The bin errors are counting statistics, so their errors will often be large and
not particularly enlightening given the small sample size in this work. 
In short, we certainly could add error bars but we don’t believe that 
would improve the figures or manuscript. We have also added more 
language both throughout the paper and in the discussion section
for taking these results with a grain of salt because of the sample size.


Table 2.
Could you please put the L=X L* for each galaxy in the table?

>>> Done.


Page 8.
You quote a significance level of 99.96\% by simply assuming
that the AD method is more accurate. Can you demonstrate this?
Either way, KS yields 2.4sigma while AD yields 2.9 sigma so
it is marginally significant at best. Can you bootstrap
the sample to see if this is a robust result? Also how are
you comparing the total sample to the selected sample?
Are you selecting random subsets from the total sample
of equal numbers to the selected sample and then doing
the statistical tests? Or are you comparing the total sample
and the selected sample?

>>> The Anderson-Darling test is an updated, more modern and 
accurate version of the KS test. We have simply eliminated KS 
results so as to not add confusion. Our p-value of 0.00037
corresponds to 3.56sigma. The test considers our full sample
compared to the full distribution of galaxy inclination angles, and
tests the likelihood of getting the sample by drawing random 
samples from the full distribution.


Page 8.
You can remove ``it is worth nothing here that the observed distribution
of galaxy inclination angles is not flat, as one might naively expect'
This is something every astronomer should know.

>>> We agree that every astronomer SHOULD know this. However, we 
didn’t when we first found this result, so we would like to include it for
completeness’ sake.


Page 8, Section 3.3
The findings of most of the absorption within 100 km/s could be an
artifact of splitting absorption systems and assigning lower priority
to them. Can you address this? Also, there is a significant body of the
work that could be referenced here also showing this for Lya, OIV,
MgII etc.

>>> This is addressed in the final paragraph of Section 3.3. In short, 
we would actually expect the OPPOSITE given our method. 


Page 8, Section 3.3
The authors state that there is a difference between blue- and
redshifted velocities with Vblue=68\pm16 and Vred=108\pm20
and EWblue 329\pm52 and EWred 245\pm34.

-The difference between Vblue and Vred is only 1.1sigma.
-The difference between EWblue and EWred is 0.98 sigma.

Therefore, as quoted, there is not significant difference seen here.

Figure 8.
There is no need for this Figure, this is more relevant for
a thesis and not a paper.

>>> We have found that many people are unfamiliar with
azimuth, and very few papers actually define it clearly. We would
prefer to keep this figure to maximize reader clarity and inclusion.


I highly suggest adding a discussion of the results found here,
this would add increase the impact and add a lot to the paper.

>>> Done. Thank you for all your helpful suggestions.
