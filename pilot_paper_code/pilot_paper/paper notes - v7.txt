copy the system plots from /d/cos/mrk290/system/3264.. etc to an appendix for the paper

do the completeness Lstar plot for SDSS and nonSDSS parts of the sky

only include sightlines that are used - table 1 and table 2 have the same sightlines

look at each case, only keep the large galaxies that work.
